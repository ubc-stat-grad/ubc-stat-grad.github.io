# 2023 van Eeden seminar

This year,
the	Constance van Eeden speaker was
[Dr. Kevin Murphy](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/) of Google.
Dr. Murphy gave a talk on Thursday, February 2, 2023
on a unified perspective of machine learning research.

**Title:** A Probabilistic Perspective on the Field of Machine Learning


**Abstract:**
I will present a unified perspective on the field of
machine learning research, following the structure of my recent book, 
Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics. 
In particular, I will discuss various models and algorithms 
for tackling the following key tasks: 
prediction, generation, discovery, and control. 
For each of these tasks, I will also briefly summarize a few of my own contributions, 
including methods for robust prediction under distribution shift, 
methods for generating high-resolution images, 
methods for discovering hidden regimes in high-dimensional time series data, 
and methods for statistically efficient online decision making.
