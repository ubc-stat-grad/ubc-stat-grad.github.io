# Sports in UBC statistics

We frequently play sports together,
either as a group just to have fun or in a departmental team as part of a league.

## Table tennis

Table tennis is happening on Fridays at 4 pm! Players usually arrive early
to help set up the table tennis table. Contact David Xu for more information.


## Running

We run semi-regularly around UBC, especially during the sunny months. 
We meet in front of ESB and usually end at a coffee shop on campus. 
During weekdays, we usually run between 5km and 8km either before or after work.
On the weekends, we sometimes do longer runs 
(like UBC to downtown or long runs in the trails of Pacific Spirit Park).
Runs are at a casual/no drop pace, 
i.e., slow enough so that everyone has a good time!

if you want to join!

The *Mean Squared Terrors* is the department's soccer team,
