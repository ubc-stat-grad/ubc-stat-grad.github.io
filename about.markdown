# About us

The graduate students of the Department of Statistics organize many different
events. Students (especially new ones) were sometimes at a loss trying to keep
track of all the things happening. We created this website to centralize
the information of all the activities, with the hope of making it easy
to stay on top of things&mdash;and to get involved as well!
