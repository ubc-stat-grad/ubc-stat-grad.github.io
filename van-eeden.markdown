# Dr. Constance van Eeden seminar

The van Eeden seminar is a yearly event in which graduate students
vote for their favorite statisticians.
The winner is contacted by the organizing committee and invited
to give a talk in the department's seminar.
The speaker spends one or two days on-campus,
and graduate students have the opportunity to have lunch and dinner with them.

## This year's speaker

The Constance van Eeden Speaker for 2025 will be 
[Dr. Arnaud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/), Senior Staff Research 
Scientist at Google DeepMind. 
Dr. Doucet’s research interests lie in the development and analysis of efficient computational methods for inference and learning, machine learning, signal processing and related areas. 
He will visit our department on **Friday, April 4th 2025**.

**Seminar Title:**  From Diffusion Models to Schrödinger Bridges - When Generative
Modeling meets Optimal Transport

**Event Date:** Friday, April 4th, 2025 - 10:30 am to 12:00 pm PT

**Invited Speaker:** Dr. Arnaud Doucet, Senior Staff Research Scientist at Google DeepMind

**Location:** Online or ESB 5104/5106 at the University of British Columbia

**Zoom registration:** [https://ubc.zoom.us/meeting/register/Z_eCE0H9QqGknxiuC66eBg](https://ubc.zoom.us/meeting/register/Z_eCE0H9QqGknxiuC66eBg)

**Abstract:** 
Denoising Diffusion models have revolutionized generative
modeling. Conceptually, these methods define a transport mechanism from
a noise distribution to a data distribution. Recent advancements have
extended this framework to define transport maps between arbitrary
distributions, significantly expanding the potential for unpaired data
translation. However, existing methods often fail to approximate optimal
transport maps, which are theoretically known to possess advantageous
properties. In this talk, we will show how one can modify current
methodologies to compute Schrödinger bridges—an entropy-regularized
variant of dynamic optimal transport. We will demonstrate this
methodology on a variety of unpaired data translation tasks.

**More Information:**
Dr. Arnaud Doucet has been invited to be this year's van Eeden speaker by the 
graduate students in the Department of Statistics at the University of British 
Columbia. A van Eeden speaker is a prominent statistician who is chosen each 
year to give a lecture, supported by the 
[UBC Constance van Eeden Fund](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/constance-van-eeden-fund). 
The 2024 seminar is additionally sponsored by the 
[Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute (CANSSI)](https://canssi.ca/), the 
[Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS)](https://www.pims.math.ca/), 
and the [Walter H. Gage Memorial Fund](https://vpstudents.ubc.ca/walter-gage/).

## About

The van Eeden seminar is supported by the Constance van Eeden fund,
which was established by [Dr. van Eeden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_van_Eeden)
(1927&ndash;2021) in 1998.
Dr. van Eeden was a mathematical statistician who made foundational
contributions to estimation in restricted parameter spaces
and nonparametric statistics.

The van Eeden fund is used to support many other activities on top of the
student-invited speaker talk, such as
inviting visiting professors for a week or more;
organizing statistics summer schools;
and giving out admissions awards to promising graduate students.
