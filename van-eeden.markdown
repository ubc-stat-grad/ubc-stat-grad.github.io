# Dr. Constance van Eeden seminar

The van Eeden seminar is a yearly event in which graduate students
vote for their favorite statisticians.
The winner is contacted by the organizing committee and invited
to give a talk in the department's seminar.
The speaker spends one or two days on-campus,
and graduate students have the opportunity to have lunch and dinner with them.

## This year's speaker
**Update**: The [recording for this year's van Eeden seminar](https://youtu.be/b5amDncmm68) is now available!

We have some exciting news---the Constance van Eeden Speaker for 2023 will be [Dr. Kevin Murphy](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/) of Google!
Dr. Murphy will visit our department on Thursday, February 2nd, 2023. He will give a lecture on a soon-to-be-decided topic, 
and hold short meetings with any interested student. We will follow up with more details closer to the date. Please contact David Xu

## About

The van Eeden seminar is supported by the Constance van Eeden fund,
which was established by [Dr. van Eeden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_van_Eeden)
(1927&ndash;2021) in 1998.
Dr. van Eeden was a mathematical statistician who made foundational
contributions to estimation in restricted parameter spaces
and nonparametric statistics.

The van Eeden fund is used to support many other activities on top of the
student-invited speaker talk, such as
inviting visiting professors for a week or more;
organizing statistics summer schools;
and giving out admissions awards to promising graduate students.
