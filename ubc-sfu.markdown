# UBC-SFU Joint Statistics Seminar

The UBC-SFU Joint Statistics Seminar is now in its 19th year (as of 2023).
The event is organized twice per year by students from UBC and SFU.
The purpose of the seminar is to give graduate students
an opportunity to share their research and work projects with one another.
At the end of the seminar, a guest faculty member gives a talk and
the attendees get an opportunity to network over a *free* lunch.

The Fall (usually in November) seminar is hosted by SFU
while the Spring (commonly in late February) seminar is hosted by UBC.
