# UBC-SFU Joint Statistics Seminar

The UBC-SFU Joint Statistics Seminar is now in its 21st year (as of 2025).
The event is organized twice per year by students from UBC and SFU.
The purpose of the seminar is to give graduate students
an opportunity to share their research and work projects with one another.
At the end of the seminar, a guest faculty member gives a talk and
the attendees get an opportunity to network over a *free* lunch.

The Fall (usually in November) seminar is hosted by SFU
while the Spring (commonly in early March) seminar is hosted by UBC.

<!-- ## Spring 2024 seminar

We are very excited this term to bring the seminar home, 
to be hosted at UBC for the first time (to our knowledge)! 
The event will be held on **Saturday, March 9th at ESB,** 
and will be professionally catered (complimentary coffee/tea, breakfast and lunch). 
There will be talks by six students (three from UBC and three from SFU) and one faculty member from UBC. 
After, we will have a social hour for further discussions at Browns Crafthouse.
