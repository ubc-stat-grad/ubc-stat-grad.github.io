# Mental health resources

Pursuing a graduate degree can often feel like both a sprint and a marathon, but it's important that you prioritize your mental (and physical) health!
If you need a little support, UBC offers various services and resources. Some examples of these resources include

* [Counselling Services](https://students.ubc.ca/health/counselling-services)
* [Aspiria](https://students.ubc.ca/health/ubc-student-assistance-program-sap)
* [Wellness Centre](https://students.ubc.ca/health/wellness-centre)

For more information about these or other resources, the [Student Services webpage](https://students.ubc.ca/health) and the [resources for graduate students webpage](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/current-students/health-wellbeing-safety) are a great place to start.

If you are just feeling a little down and would like to talk to someone, reach out to any of the [graduate student executives](./about.html)! We'd be happy to chat and to help if we can :)
