# Graduate student positions

Various positions and activities in the department are filled and organized by
graduate student volunteers (see the list below).
An open recruitment for these positions is usually done at the beginning of the academic year.
If a position that you're interested in is still open for the academic year,
contact the Graduate Student Representative to see how you can get involved!

## Open positions

| Position/activity | People in charge | Available positions |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| SGSA Executive Committee | [Isaac](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/isaac-e-u-c-rankin) <br/> [Angeline](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/angeline-y-xiao) <br/> [Jessica](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/jia-ni-jessica-xu) <br/> [Son](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/son-luu) <br/> [Hasmik](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/hasmik-margaryan)| **1--5** |
| Social Committee | [Angeline](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/angeline-y-xiao) <br/> [Jessica](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/jia-ni-jessica-xu) | **Always open!** |


**SGSA Executive Committee Positions**\\
*Volunteers needed:* 1--3\\
*Duties:* 
If you are interested in being the SGSA Graduate Student Representative, 
SGSA Treasurer, SGSA Webmaster, or organizer for Department seminars, please consider applying! 
These positions play a bigger role in SGSA operations 
and require more commitment than the ones below.

**Social Committee** \\
*Volunteers needed:* 2-3 minimum, but always open! \\
*Duties:* i) organize semi-regular social hangouts. These can range from ordering sushi to
eat at the department, to going out for dinner somewhere in Vancouver, to organizing a
hike! ii) organize the end-of-term graduate hangouts (one per each term); iii) monitor the
#social channel on Slack.\\
*Funding available!* The end-of-term hangouts are fully funded by SGSA, and additional
funding is available for each hangout (depending on the number of events, we might be
able to cover part or all of the bill).

<!--
**Fundraiser** \\
*Volunteers needed:* 2--3 \\
*Duties:* organize fundraising events for the SGSA. In the past these took the form of
exam sales: sample finals were created and sold to undergrads. This year, we are open
to other fundraising ideas as well. The results of your work would have a direct impact on
the budget available for other SGSA events.
