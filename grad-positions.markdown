# Graduate student positions

Various positions and activities in the department are filled and organized by
graduate student volunteers (see the list below).
An open recruitment for these positions is usually done at the beginning of the academic year.
If a position that you're interested in is still open for the academic year,
contact the Graduate Student Representative to see how you can get involved!

## Open positions

| Position/activity | People in charge | Available positions |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| SGSA Executive Committee | [Gian Carlo](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/gian-carlo-di-luvi)<br/>[Kenny](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/kenny-chiu)<br/>[Nikola](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/nikola-surjanovic) | **1--3** |
| USS Coordinator	| New position! | **1-2** |
| Social Committee | [Silke](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/silke-sophia-rice)<br/>[Charlotte](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/charlotte-edgar) | **Always open!** |
| Fundraiser | | **2--3** |


**SGSA Executive Committee Positions**\\
*Volunteers needed:* 1--3\\
*Duties:* we aren’t gonna be around forever, and so we’d like to train our replacements. If you are interested in being the SGSA Graduate Student Representative, SGSA Treasurer, or SGSA Webmaster, please consider applying! These positions play a bigger role in SGSA operations and require more commitment than the ones below. If you are interested in any of these positions, you should be willing to commit to at least two years: one year being mentored by the current position member and another afterwards.

**USS Coordinator** \\
*Volunteers needed:* 1--2 \\
*Duties:* be the liaison between the SGSA and the USS (Undergraduate Statistics Society) at UBC. 
Duties would likely involve being the person of contact for the USS, attending meetings 
with USS executives as necessary, and organizing/finding volunteers to organize events held 
in collaboration with the USS. Examples of possible events include a ``Meet a Grad Student''
session for statistics undergraduates and research/co-op flash talk sessions.


**Social Committee** \\
*Volunteers needed:* 2-3 minimum, but always open! \\
*Duties:* i) organize semi-regular social hangouts. These can range from ordering sushi to
eat at the department, to going out for dinner somewhere in Vancouver, to organizing a
hike! ii) organize the end-of-term graduate hangouts (one per each term); iii) monitor the
#social channel on Slack.\\
*Funding available!* The end-of-term hangouts are fully funded by SGSA, and additional
funding is available for each hangout (depending on the number of events, we might be
able to cover part or all of the bill).


**Fundraiser** \\
*Volunteers needed:* 2--3 \\
*Duties:* organize fundraising events for the SGSA. In the past these took the form of
exam sales: sample finals were created and sold to undergrads. This year, we are open
to other fundraising ideas as well. The results of your work would have a direct impact on
the budget available for other SGSA events.
