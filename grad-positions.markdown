# Graduate student positions

Various positions and activities in the department are filled and organized by
graduate student volunteers (see the list below).
An open recruitment for these positions is usually done at the beginning of the academic year.
If a position that you're interested in is still open for the academic year,
contact the Graduate Student Representative to see how you can get involved!

*Duties:* organize fundraising events for the SGSA. In the past these took the form of

the budget available for other SGSA events.

would be to go to CUPE meetings and advise SGSA/stats office if needed.

*Duties:* i) organize semi-regular social hangouts. These can range from ordering sushi to
eat at the department, to going out for dinner somewhere in Vancouver, to organizing a
hike! ii) organize the end-of-term graduate hangouts (one per each term); iii) monitor the
#social channel on Slack.
Funding available! The end-of-term hangouts are fully funded by SGSA, and additional
funding is available for each hangout (depending on the number of events, we might be
able to cover part or all of the bill).
