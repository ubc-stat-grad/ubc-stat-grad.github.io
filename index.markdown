# Welcome!

We are the Statistics Graduate Student Association (SGSA)
at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/).

We created this website for new, current, 
and prospective graduate students in the
[Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/).
Here, you can find information about the various activities and events
that statistics graduate students organize&mdash;all in a single place!

We also aim to create a sense of community in the department 
and to make it as easy as possible for everyone to get involved.
Enjoy!
