# Welcome!

We are the graduate student association of the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/)
at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/).

We created this website for new, current, and prospective graduate students in the department.
Here, you can find information about the various activities and events
that statistics graduate students organize&mdash;all in a single place!

We also aim to create a sense of community in the department and to make it as easy as possible for everyone to get involved.
Enjoy!
