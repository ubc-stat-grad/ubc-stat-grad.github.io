# Graduate student seminars: by graduate students for graduate students

While the department has [its own seminar series](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/events-calendar),
the graduate students at UBC statistics also run their own seminars, which
have a much more relaxed and informal tone.
There's always free food for all attendees!

These seminars provide an ideal opportunity for current graduate students to
practice research presentations in a friendly environment.
We also frequently invite alumni that are working in the industry to
share their job-hunting and post-academic experience.

## New this year: Career Fireside Chat

We are excited to announce the launch of a new *Career Fireside Chat* series of seminars 
in addition to our regular Research series of seminars. 
This brand new career panel is designed to build bridges between 
our graduate students who are eager to learn more about diverse statistics-related career paths 
and other graduate students who have had tangible experience working in industry.

During each of the Career Fireside chats, 
we will invite *experienced speakers* who are current or former graduate students 
in the Department of Statistics to share their career paths with you. 
The format for these events will include a brief overview of each speaker's experience, 
highlighting their key milestones and lessons learned in their role. 
After the speaker's introduction, we invite the audience to participate in an engaging Q&A session 
with the speaker to ask questions and seek advice directly from our speakers. 
Please bring your questions!
