# Graduate student seminars: by graduate students for graduate students

While the department has [its own seminar series](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/events-calendar),
the graduate students at UBC statistics also run their own seminars, which
have a much more relaxed and informal tone.
There's always free pizza for all attendees!

These seminars provide an ideal opportunity for current graduate students to
practice research presentations in a friendly environment.
We also frequently invite alumni that are working in the industry to
share their job-hunting and post-academic experience.

The seminars will be in-person for the 2023&ndash;2024 academic year,
but they will also be broadcast through Zoom.

We are always looking for presenters! If you are interested,
