# Reading groups

Multiple professors within the department organize reading groups
for current and incoming graduate students.
In these, the discussion leader chooses a paper related to the theme
of the reading group and then presents it&mdash;although the idea is to
have a discussion between participants, rather than a presentation.

If you are a first-year master's student,
reading groups are a great way to get to know professors and their research,
and to get them to know you as well.
This makes choosing a supervisor further down the road much easier.

This is a (non-exhaustive) list of reading groups happening in the department.
Reach out to the contact person if you wish to join.


## Animal movement and distribution reading group
PI: [Dr. Marie Auger-Méthé](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/marie-auger-methe)
and [Dr. Nancy Heckman](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/nancy-e-heckman) \
Contact: [Evan Sidrow](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/evan-sidrow)

The Animal Movement and Distribution Reading Group is a group of graduate students,
faculty and postdoctoral fellows in the Statistics Department and the
Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries that meet every two weeks to discuss papers
that use animal movement and distribution data to answer important questions in ecology.
Typically, data are from tracking devices attached to animals.
Methods of analysis include hidden Markov models, state space models and
continuous time stochastic processes.
At each meeting, a group member leads discussion on a paper,
with discussions benefiting from the mix of backgrounds of group members.


## Computational Bayes reading group
PI: [Dr. Trevor Campbell](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/trevor-campbell) \
Contact: [Gian Carlo Diluvi](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/gian-carlo-di-luvi)

This year, we are reading the book
[*An Introduction to Sequential Monte Carlo* 
by Chopin and Papaspiliopoulos](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-47845-2)
one chapter at a time.
Each week, we hold a 1.5-hour discussion which is led by a rotating presenter.
The presenter can choose the format, although whiteboard is preferred.
The goal is for the reading group to be a 
low pressure and informal environment for all of us to learn. 
Previously, we did a review of 
linearly convergent stochastic optimization methods
and before that we discussed 
work on variational methods.


## Symmetry, invariance, probability and machine learning reading group
PI: [Dr. Benjamin Bloem-Reddy](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/ben-bloem-reddy) \
Contact: [Johnny Xi](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/quanhan-johnny-xi)

The Symmetry, Invariance, Probability and Machine Learning (SIP-ML) reading
group consists of Statistics and Computer Science graduate students, postdocs
and faculty who meet every week to discuss a paper or book chapter
in the statistics and machine learning literature.
This year we are reading the book 
[*Optimal Transport for Applied Mathematics*
by Filippo Santambrogio](https://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~santambrogio/OTAM-cvgmt.pdf).
Group members rotate weekly as the discussion leader, 
whose role is to casually present the material and promote discussion. 
Topics of interest in previous terms were diverse and ranged from
empirical Bayes to normalizing flows, 
including a summer's worth of Le Cam theory. 
We also spent a term reading papers on
invariant representation learning, causal invariance, 
domain adaptation and robustness to distributional shifts.


## Bayesian statistics reading group (MCMC methods and applications in phylogenetics)
PI: [Dr. Alexandre Bouchard-C&ocirc;t&eacute;](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/alexandre-bouchard-cote) \
Contact: [Nikola Surjanovic](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/nikola-surjanovic)

The focus of this reading group is generally on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods and its applications in phylogenetics. Students take turns presenting on
research topics that are of interest to the group, with presentations lasting about
60-90 minutes. The group meets once per week. For more information,
please contact the PI or the student contact.


## Epidemiology reading group
PI: [Dr. Daniel J. McDonald](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/daniel-j-mcdonald) \
Contact: [Rachel Lobay](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/rachel-lobay)

In the Epidemiology Reading Group, we look at statistical solutions to
epidemiological problems. That is, we consider an interesting paper, book or
article on epidemiological advances and discuss the mathematical models and the
statistical approaches used to estimate them. Meetings are weekly for about an
hour. Possible topics include the mathematical modelling of COVID-19 hospitalizations,
forecasting case or hospitalization counts via predictive modelling, and techniques
for longitudinal data analysis, amongst others.
